to my website! I am a PhD candidate in Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Montana. My research focuses on proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS), including instrument characterization, long-term ambient VOC measurements, and mobile laboratory deployments during prescribed fire events with [Prof. Lu Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7WP7T3QAAAAJ&hl=en). 

**Key research questions I aim to address include:**
- How can wildfire emissions and atmospheric chemistry be better represented in CTMs to reduce biases in simulated air quality?
- How does smoke composition evolve from fresh plumes to multi-day aged pollution, and which processes control oxidant formation and secondary pollutants?
- What roles do reactive VOC classes (e.g., furanoids and other oxygenated species) play in ozone formation and secondary pollution in smoke-impacted regions?
- How can chemically resolved wildfire smoke exposure metrics improve population-scale health assessments beyond PM₂.₅ mass alone?
