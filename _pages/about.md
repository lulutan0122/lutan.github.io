Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in Atmospheric Chemistry at the University of Montana, working with [Prof. Lu Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7WP7T3QAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on **proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS)**, including instrument characterization for VCP VOCs, long-term ambient VOC measurements, and mobile laboratory deployments measuring prescribed fire emissions. I am particularly interested in improving the quantitative interpretation of VOC observations and their implications for emissions and atmospheric chemistry.

**Key research questions I aim to address include:**
- How can PTR-ToF-MS performance (e.g., sensitivity, fragmentation, humidity dependence) be better characterized to improve quantitative VCP VOCs measurements?
- What are the dominant sources and seasonal drivers of reactive VOCs in urban environments?
- How do prescribed fire emissions compare to wildfire emissions?
