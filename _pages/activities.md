Here you can find a glimpse of my life beyond science.

I’m an ENFJ who genuinely enjoys connecting with people and finding joy in everyday moments. 
Outside of research, I love playing life-simulation and farming games—especially Stardew Valley—where slow progress, creativity, and long-term planning feel oddly therapeutic. I’m also a big fan of music: I enjoy singing, listening to all kinds of songs, and occasionally getting lost in playlists while working or relaxing.

When I’m not gaming or listening to music, I enjoy cooking, traveling, hiking, and staying active. This section is still under development, and I plan to add more personal notes, figures, and small records along the way. Stay tuned!
