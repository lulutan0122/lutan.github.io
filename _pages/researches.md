## Overall
My Ph.D. work at the University of Montana (Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling Group) focused on improving PTR-MS for VOC quantification and emissions of prescribed burns.
**quantitative characterization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere**, with an emphasis on improving measurement accuracy, source attribution, and interpretation of VOC observations in urban environments and wildfire-influenced regions.

**Representative research questions:**
- How can PTR-ToF-MS performance (e.g., sensitivity, fragmentation, humidity dependence) be better characterized to improve quantitative VOC measurements?
- How do prescribed fire emissions compare to wildfires?
- How can detailed VOC measurements improve interpretation of atmospheric reactivity and secondary pollutant formation?

## PTR-ToF-MS Instrument Characterization
A major component of my research is **evaluating and improving PTR-ToF-MS performance for quantitative VOC measurements**, particularly for oxygenated and volatile chemical product (VCP)-related species.

My work includes:
- Laboratory characterization of **instrument sensitivity, fragmentation patterns, and humidity and E/N dependence** for selected VCP VOCs.
- Assessment of **isomeric and fragment interferences** and their implications for ambient quantification.
- Evaluation of uncertainty and detection limits for compounds without direct calibration standards.

This work supports more robust interpretation of PTR-ToF-MS datasets and provides guidance for applying the technique to complex atmospheric mixtures.

## Long-term Urban VOC Measurements
I analyze **multi-year stationary PTR-ToF-MS measurements** collected in Missoula, Montana (2020–2021) to investigate VOC seasonality, source influences, and atmospheric processing in an urban environment.

Key aspects of this work include:
- Characterizing seasonal and diurnal patterns of VOCs associated with **biogenic emissions, volatile chemical products, traffic, and biomass burning**.
- Identifying tracers that enable selective quantification (e.g., benzyl alcohol) and evaluating their utility for source attribution.
- Assessing relationships between VOCs, criteria pollutants, and meteorological drivers.

This dataset provides a rare long-term, high-time-resolution view of urban VOC composition in the western United States.

## Mobile Laboratory Measurements of Prescribed Fires
I conduct **mobile laboratory measurements during prescribed fire events** to quantify real-world emissions of gases and particles from biomass burning.

My contributions include:
- Deployment of PTR-ToF-MS and supporting instrumentation in a mobile platform during prescribed burns.
- Derivation of **emission ratios and emission factors** for VOCs, particulate matter, and optical properties.
- Examination of variability in emissions across fire conditions and burn phases.

These measurements help constrain emission inventories and improve understanding of how prescribed fires differ from wildfires in their atmospheric impacts.

## Linking Measurements to Atmospheric Impacts
Across these projects, I emphasize **measurement-driven interpretation** of atmospheric chemistry. By combining laboratory characterization, stationary observations, and mobile field measurements, my work contributes to improved understanding of VOC sources, emissions, and their roles in atmospheric reactivity.
